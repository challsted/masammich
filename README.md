This is ment to be a dynamically pulled website for masammich.tecnoanomaly.com

Currently there is nothing good on it, but it will slowly be updated. 

Currently at Phase 1

Phase 1: Build a skeleton with bare essentials and a little bit of test pages

Phase 2: Get index.html page to a working state of more then just a header/footer

Phase 3: Convert a large chunk or all of the origonal blog from WP to here and get the code fixed to look better then the way it currently does on WP

Phase 4: Get index to allow for imported content (dynamically hopefully) of any posts added (iframe?)

Phase 5: Work to remove all the extra bootstrap and convert to the .min version of code to speed up the code

Phase 6: Begin to convert to rails?
