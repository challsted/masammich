#Mission Statement

This is a personal project to help teach me webdesign, i am useing Twitter Bootstrap 3.3.0 with the "clean-blog" theme from startbootstrap

I will use this area to list my current goals, there sub-goals, and the the progess though them, this is not set in stone, i may change various parts of this as this whole thing is fluid right now. Currently looking for another dev to help with this if interested, but even if i had another dev, it would just be to add content based on current templates, and suggest updates to the rest of the code. 

##Tracking Issues with the Issue Tracker

Plan on possibly adding a wiki, but not really sure what for...
