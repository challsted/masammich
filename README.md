#Mission Statement

This is a personal project to help teach me webdesign, i am useing Twitter Bootstrap 3.3.0 with the "slate" theme from bootswatch.com

I will use this area to list my current goals, there sub-goals, and the the progess though them, this is not set in stone, i may change various parts of this as this whole thing is fluid right now. Currently looking for another dev to help with this if interested, but even if i had another dev, it would just be to add content based on current templates, and suggest updates to the rest of the code. 

##Currently in Phase 3

Phase 1: Build a skeleton with bare essentials and a little bit of test pages &check; complete!

	1) get an index page working with BS &check;

	2) get a good looking header with BS &check;

		2.1) use js to include header to the page instead of header on every page &check;

	3) get a footer that shows license &check;

		3.1) use js to include header to the page instead of header on every page &check;

	4) get a darker theme then default &check;

Phase 2: Get index.html page to a working state of more then just a header/footer, and get a contact though email working &check; complete!

	1) add some columns with generic info as a place holder and tell viewers about the page &check;

	2) get a contact page up with fields to add info &check;

	3) make contact page actually send email &check;


Phase 3: Convert a large chunk or all of the origonal blog from WP to here and get the code fixed to look better then the way it currently does on WP

	1) pre-make the html files from a template

	2) start copying the "html" from Wordpress and add it to the new html files

	3) fix the to look better on my site (get them looking good not nesecarily perfect)
	
	4) fix the "code" to actually look like its something to type not just bold/italics (css)

Phase 4: Get index to allow for imported content (dynamically hopefully) of any posts added (iframe?)

Phase 5: Work to remove all the extra bootstrap and convert to the .min version of code to speed up the code

Phase 6: Begin to convert to rails?
