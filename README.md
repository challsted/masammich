#Mission Statement

This is a personal project to help teach me webdesign, i am useing Twitter Bootstrap 3.3.0 with the "slate" theme from bootswatch.com

I will use this area to list my current goals, there sub-goals, and the the progess though them, this is not set in stone, i may change various parts of this as this whole thing is fluid right now. Currently looking for another dev to help with this if interested, but even if i had another dev, it would just be to add content based on current templates, and suggest updates to the rest of the code. 

##Currently in Phase 3


<li>Phase 1: Build a skeleton with bare essentials and a little bit of test pages  complete!</li>

		<li>get a good looking header with BS</li>

		</ol>
