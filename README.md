Homepage
========

This is ment to be a simple homepage filled with links. 

Its designed to be in 10 "Columns" by default they are set to 120px wide each

As I write this, there is a "skeleton" html page, which is nothing but the bare bones setup. 

The CSS is pretty well commented (almost every line is comented), so if you need to remove colums, change fonts, change the color scheme, move anything around, or what ever, its all documented pretty well if you dont know css at all or not well. 

The jQuery.js file will probably never be updated, it might actually be removed entirely if i can figure out how to replace it. 

I recieved this whole thing from a guy i work with, i changed the colors to the black/green scheme, changed the lines to fit my work screen, 100% re-wrote all the links, then desided i like it so much at work, i wanted to use it at home too. 
Thats what this is, my work brought home and all the work part stipped out. 

The numbers at the top are the Fibonacci Sequence.
