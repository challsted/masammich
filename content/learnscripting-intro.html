<h2>Hello Internet!</h2>

Welcome to my attempt at makeing a class for you guys ang girls to learn shell scripting (SH Scripting).<br/>
From there you can take the extra steps to learn the "sugar" of BASH, KSH or any other shell that is based on SH (which is most all of them).<br/>

Throughout this little expiriment, I will refer to SH as "Shell" or as "sh". I will also refer to SH as being "basic" or "minimal". 
I also like to use the term "sugar" to explain the extra features provided by other shell's. One example I like to use when explaining this is that when you script with BASH you can use 2 brackets to further expand options [[..]] but this is not a possibity in KSH. <br/>

<h3>What I expect from you, the reader</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>You have access to a Linux or Unix box</li>
		<li>If you are useing a GUI on this box, you know how to open a terminal, your already in a terminal if you dont have a GUI</li>
		<li>I expect you to have a text editor, terminal or GUI</li>
		<ul>
			<li>I will always expect that you are using <a href="../dark/vim-breakdown.html">vim</a></li>
			<li>You are welcome to use any other text editor, such as emacs, gedit(gnome), kate(KDE), notepad++(you'll need wine), or sublime(version 3 for linux is solid, and has an ulimited beta) to name a few</li>
			<li>As a reminder, you can create or edit the script from terminal like this:</li>
				<ul>
					<code class="codeInput">vi scriptname.sh</code><br/>
					<code class="codeInput">emacs scriptname.sh</code><br/>
					<code class="codeInput">gedit scriptname.sh</code><br/>
					<code class="codeInput">kate scriptname.sh</code><br/>
					<code class="codeInput">subl scriptname.sh</code><br/>
				</ul>
			<!-- Might need to move last </li> here -->
		</ul>
		<li>I expect you to mark all of your scripts as executable, you can use <code class="codeInput">chmod +x</code> or any other method that gives the executable flag. If you want more information about linux permissions, see my other article <a href="../dark/linuxpermissions.html">Linux Permissions Article</a></li>
		<li>I expect you to know how to execute your scripts once you have saved them (<code class="codeInput">./scriptname.sh</code>).</li>
	</ul>

<h3>What you, the reader, can expect from me</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>I will attempt to break everything down into major and minor sections, each major section covering a "major" topic, and within each major section being many minor sections.</li>
		<li>I will attempt to always format with differnt text colors, and differnt highlights, what is <code class="codeInput">input</code> and what is <code class="codeOutput">output</code>. So that you can quickly know <code class="codeOutput">what is being sent back to you</code>, and <code class="codeInput">what you input</code></li>
		<li>After what I believe is a large amount of information, I will provide an EoL (End of Lesson) quiz.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>At the moment they are completly self driven</li>
			<li>I will provide an answer key, and I hopefully can provide WHY some of the answers are wrong.</li>
			<li>Its up to you to not cheat and make sure you understand everything.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>If you find bugs, or issues feel free to comment about it at the bottom of the page (Requires a Disquss account). I will do my best to reply, explain, update, fix, or remove the issue.</li>
	</ul>
