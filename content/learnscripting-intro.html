<h2>Hello Internet!</h2>

Welcome to my attempt at makeing a class for you guys ang girls to learn shell scripting (SH Scripting). From here you can take the extra steps to learn the "sugar" of BASH, KSH or any  other shell that is based on SH (all of them?).<br/>

<h3>What I expect from you, the reader</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>You have access to a Linux or Unix box</li>
		<li>If you are useing a GUI on this box, you know how to open a terminal</li>
		<li>I expect you to have a text editor, terminal or gui</li>
		<ul>
			<li>I will always expect that you are using <a href="../dark/vim-breakdown.html">vim</a></li>
			<li>You are welcome to use any other text editor, such as emacs, gedit, kate, notepad++, or sublime to name a few</li>
			<li>As a reminder, you can create or edit the script from terminal like this:</li>
				<ul>
					<code class="codeInput">vi scriptname.sh</code><br/>
					<code class="codeInput">emacs scriptname.sh</code><br/>
					<code class="codeInput">gedit scriptname.sh</code><br/>
					<code class="codeInput">kate scriptname.sh</code><br/>
					<code class="codeInput">subl scriptname.sh</code><br/>
				</ul>
			<!-- Might need to move last </li> here -->
		</ul>
		<li>I expect you to mark all of your scripts as executable, you can use <code class="codeInput">chmod +x</code> or any other method that gives the executable flag. If you want more information about linux permissions, see my other article <a href="../dark/linuxpermissions.html">Linux Permissions Article</a></li>
	</ul>


<h3>What you, the reader, can expect from me</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>I will attempt to break everything down into major and minor sections, each major section covering 1 "major" topic, and within each major section being many minor sections.</li>
		<li>After what I believe is a large amount of knowledge, I will provide an EoL (End of Lesson) quiz. At the moment they are completly self driven, I will provide an answer key, and I hopefully can provide WHY some of the answers are wrong. Its up to you to not cheat and make sure you understand everything. If you find bugs, or issues feel free to comment about it at the bottom of the page (Requires a Disquss account). I will do my best to reply, explain, update, fix, or remove the issue.</li>
		<li>For further clarification, everything I ask you to do here is ment to be done in a "shell" which is also known as a "terminal". </li>
