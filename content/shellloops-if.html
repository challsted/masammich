<h2>If Loops!</h2>

<h3>Types of loops</h3>

There are several types of loops, and each type has a different purpose, we will be covering the following types of loops.

<ul>
	<li><a href="shellloops-if.html">if</a></li>
	<li><a href="shellloops-while.html">while</a></li>
	<li><a href="shellloops-for.html">for</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>What is a "loop"?</h3>
<p>
They are called this because they "loop" or iterate though data or instructions until they are no longer true. To be able to understand what I mean by "until they are no longer true", you must understand what is known as "Boolean Logic". Boolean logic (very simplified) is a "true or false" "1 or 0", basically, its always one way or the other.<br/>
</p>

<h3>What is an "if" loop?</h3>
<p>
As explained above, loops iterate over data until they are false, an if loop checks every things its given 1 time to see if its true or not. If it is true then it preforms an action on the data, if its false then it passes over it.<br/>

If loops consist of 5 manditory parts, and 2 optional parts.<br/>
<ol>
	<li>They always opens with the word "if"</li>
	<li>Then a statement that has to qualify to true<sup><sup>1</sup></sup> inside of brakets []<sup><sup>2</sup></sup></li>
	<li>The word "then" with a simicolon<sup><sup>3</sup></sup></li>
	<li>A command to preform if the statement is true</li>
	<li>A closeing "fi" (which is "if" backwards)</li>
</ol>
<h6><sup>1</sup> Only has to be true if you dont use an else(below)<br/>
<sup>2</sup> The brakets are used to say "inside of here needs to be true or false"<br/>
<sup>3</sup> Simicolon is only needed if you dont put it on a new line (example below)</h6>
An example of that would look like this:<br/><br/>

With a simicolon:<br/>
<code class="codeInput">
A = 1<br/>
B = 2<br/>
if [ $A &lt; $B ] then;<br/>
&Tab;echo "A is less then B"<br/>
fi<br/><br/>
</code>

Without a simicolon:<br/>
<code class="codeInput">
A = 11<br/>
B = 2<br/>
if [ $A &lt; $B ]<br/>
then<br/>
&Tab;echo "A is less then B"<br/>
fi<br/><br/>
</code>
</p>

<h4>What about those optional parts?</h4>
<p>
<strong>else</strong> is the first optional piece, else has a cool effect on an if loop, it can make it take more data then it would normally be able to.<br/>
What I mean by that is <em>"if a is less then b, then tell me a is less then b, but if a is not less then b, then tell me a is greater then b"</em><br/>
The part about "but if a is not less then b then..." can be shortened down to just "else". Let me show you!<br/><br/>

With a simicolon:<sup><sup>4</sup></sup><br/>
<code class="codeInput">
A = 3<br/>
B = 2<br/>
if [ $A &lt; $B ] then;<br/>
&Tab;echo "A is less then B"<br/>
else<br>
&Tab;echo "A is greater then B"<br/>
fi<br/><br/>
</code>

Without a simicolon:<br/>
<code class="codeInput">
A = 15<br/>
B = 20<br/>
if [ $A &lt; $B ]<br/>
then<br/>
&Tab;echo "A is less then B"<br/>
else<br>
&Tab;echo "A is greater then B"<br/>
fi
</code>
<h6><sup>4</sup> I will use both methods interchangably, and I will not be doing both anymore.</h6>
</p>

<p>
How did it do that? Think of it like this.<br/>
I give you the following instructions: A is equal to 1, and B is equal to 2.<br/>
I then ask "If A is less then B, I want you to tell me that A is less then B." but i give you no other instructions. <br/>
Then your good, you tell me that 1 is less then 2.<br/>
But what if i tell you A is equal to 10, and B is equal to 2.<br/>
Then again, I ask "If A is less then B, I want you to tell me that A is less then B"<br/>
Ok, but you cant say anything to me, because I didnt tell you what to do if A is not less then B, so you would just sit there and do nothing.<br/>
If I had given you a 2nd set of instructions, saying "But if anything else happens, just tell me that A is greater then B"<br/>
That is the equivilent of an "else". Its kind of a "catch all". If the above isnt true, then do <strong>this</strong> to everything <strong><em>else</em></strong>.<br/>
</p>

<p>
<strong>elif</strong> which is a combination of the words "else and if" acts as both an else statement and an if statement, and is the last optional thing you can add to an if statement. An elif must have an else statement also.<br/>
Here is an example if, elif, else:<br/><br/>

<code class="codeInput">
A = 0<br/>
B = 8<br/>
if [ $A &lt; $B ] then;<br/>
&Tab;echo "A is less then B"<br/>
elif [ $A == 0 ] then;<br/>
&Tab;echo "A is equal to 0"<br/>
elif [ $B == 0 ] then;<br/>
&Tab;echo "B is equal to 0"<br/>
else<br/>
&Tab;echo "A is greater then B"<br/>
fi<br/><br/>
</code>

We can simplify this even further by useing a little thing called "or" which is showing in sh as "||" (the symbol commonly above the enter key, and is known as a "pipe" in unix, 2 times).<br/><br/>

<code class="codeInput">
A = -10<br/>
B = 8<br/>
if [ $A &lt; $B ] then;<br/>
&Tab;echo "A is less then B"<br/>
elif [ $A == 0 || $B == 0 ] <br/>
&Tab;echo "One of the numbers is 0"<br/>
else<br/>
&Tab;echo "A is greater then B"<br/>
fi<br/><br/>
</code>

Both of the above will check if A or B is equal to 0, and if A is not less then B and neither number is equal to 0, then it assumes that A is greater then B (pretty good chances at this point).<br/>
</p>

<h3>$VARIABLES</h3>
Lets take a quick second to explain what Variables are.<br/>
A variable is a single word or symbol that holds a value that is given to it by you or by the script.<br/>
So if I say <code class="codeInput">A=100</code>. Then later i say <code class="codeInput">echo $A</code> it will say <code class="codeOutput">100</code>.<br/>
So you should have noticed, when I was assigning the value of 100 to the letter A, I used "A" but when I called on the variable to find out the value I used "$A". This is simply so that if I assign the number "100" to the letter A, and then I type <code class="codeInput">echo "Tell Me A Joke"</code>, it wont reply <code class="codeOutput">Tell Me 100 Joke</code><br/>
Just to be through, you can assign anything to a variable, not just numbers, and a variable can be more then 1 letter.<br/>
So you can say <code class="codeInput">NAME=Chase</code>, then if you <code class="codeInput">echo $NAME</code>, it will say <code class="codeOutput">Chase</code> or you can give a variable the value of a command. But that needs special characters sourounding it. Example:<br>
<code class="codeInput">SEARCHRESULTS=`find ~ -iname *.sh`</code><br>
Then if you <code class="codeInput">echo $SEARCHRESULTS</code> it will return everyfile under your home directory that ended in .sh (if there was none, it might appear to not have worked)<br/>
Please note that after the equal's symbol i have a "`" which is not a single quote, it is usually known as a "back-tick", it is located (on most keyboards) on the same key as the ~, which is in the top left, but below the ESC key. <br/>

<h3>So lets make a script!</h3>

Lets make a quick directory just for the purpose of doing the quizes and chalanges
