<h2>Why should you utilize your ~/.ssh folder!</h2>

First off, if you don't already have one, you should probably make it with the below command <code class="codeInput">mkdir -p ~/.ssh/authorized_keys &amp;&amp; chmod -R 700 ~/.ssh &amp;&amp; cd ~/.ssh</code><br/>

This will create the folders you need, change the permissions so that only your user can access/use them, and cd into the main folder.
So, now we got our very own .ssh folder (if you didn't already have one). <br/>

We can make our own ssh key "pair" by running the following: <br/>

<code class="codeInput">ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "$(whoami)@$(hostname)-$(date -I)"</code><br/>

It will ask you what you want to name your key ("id_rsa" by default), I suggest you name it something other than that. Example, "MainDesktop_rsa" or "KitchenComputer_rsa" (hehe) you can also give it an exact path to save this to (be careful if this is not your first key, it will suggest a previous key by default if one is found)<br/>

It will then ask for a password to encrypt the key with (just press enter for no password)<br/>
Then it will generate your keys, both will have the same name, but 1 will end in ".pub" this is your "public" key the other is your "private" key. I sure you can figure our which one to share with others!! If you want to learn more about public/private key pairs. You can look into asymmetric cryptography, but that's not necessary for this lesson. I personally move my .pub into the authorized_keys folder.<br/>

<h2>Now, you have this folder called "Authorized Keys??" What is that for?</h2>

So, with this, you can literally "authorize" certain PUBLIC keys to be able to access your computer/server. This might not be very useful to you on a desktop, but it's very useful to a remote computer you connect to frequently. This is a way for a server owner to allow access to his server via a key AND a password, or maybe only a key (disable password logins for this).<br/>

So, now we're going to create a "config" file. So lets vi that baby and add the bare minimum so that you can figure out how to add stuff in the future, and we will also add an example that won't actually work, but you can edit it to make it work if you have a server to SSH to.<br/>

<p>
	<code class="codeInput">cd ~/.ssh</code><br/>
	<code class="codeInput">vi config</code><br/>
	<code class="codeInput">i</code><em> (go to insert mode)</em><br/>
	<code class="codeInput">#Host worker</code><br/>
	<code class="codeInput">#HostName worker.example.com</em></strong>#IdentityFile ~/.ssh/kitchencomputer_rsa</code> <em>(private key)</em><br/>
	<code class="codeInput"> #User joeshmoe</code> <em>(User ID on remote system)</em><br/>
	<br/>
	<code class="codeInput">ESC</code> <em>(hit the escape key)</em><br/>
	<code class="codeInput">:wq</code><br/>
	<code class="codeInput">cat config</code><br/>
</p>

Now, what we just did was we create a "config" file with an example in it (I suggest not removing the example, just always adding to the end).
The options I gave here would allow you to simply type "ssh worker" and it will authenticate you as "joeshmoe" on the remote server "worker.example.com" and it will use the private key "kitchencomputer_rsa" (this is the equivalent of <code class="codeInput">ssh joeshmoe@worker.example.com -i ~/.ssh/kitchencomputer_rsa</code>)<br/>

<em>TIP: So, want to make it even easier? Add this to your .bashrc .fishrc or .zshrc "alias worker="ssh worker"</em><br/>

I'll try to add more info here later, about configuring an ssh server on your local machine. How to play with config files for ssh, to allow for X11 Forwarding, passwordless authentication, and maybe some cool things that a remote ssh server can be good for.<br/>
