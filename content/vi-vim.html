<p>Ok, so before I go into details, I chose to use VI, I have never given emacs a try, and I hate nano/pico.<br>

If you have no idea what I'm talking about, just ignore that! It's a huge war apparently going on and from what I personally see, VI is winning.<br>

So, lets break this up into a few sections, and I even have a game for you to play! Yippee!</p>

<p><a href="#s1">What is VI, Vim, Emacs, Pico, Nano, Joe all of these crazy names!?</a></p>

<p><a href="#s2">Now that I know what Vi/Vim is, whats so great about it?</a></p>

<p><a href="#s3">You said there was a game?</a></p>

<h3 id="s1">What is VI, Vim, Emacs (and all the others)?</h3>

<p> They are command line text editors. they do everything a normal notepad or gedit will do, but with out a GUI installed.
It's all done right there in the terminal/shell! A lot of people think its scary/difficult and I'm not going to lie, it's not EASY. But if you force yourself to edit all config files and small documents (nothing big and fancy) with one of them, you will learn them. I use VI at work and Vim at home (Vim is just Vi with extra stuff by default). As I mentioned above, Emacs is also a major text editor that a lot of people use and there are also many others that claim to have various features that make it easier to use. In my opinion, if you don't know how to use any of them, then they are all equally easy to learn because no matter what, you're learning from scratch. But that's my opinion.<br>
<strong><b>>Why did I choose VI/Vim instead of another one?</b></strong><br>

Well, as I said, I use it at work, so I have learned to use it pretty well. Hitting :q or :wq is second nature to me now. (quit, and write and then quit respectively).</p>

<h3 id="s2">Whats so good about Vi/Vim and how do I use it?</h3>

<p>Whats so good about Vi/Vim?</strong><br>

It's really handy because it loads instantly, even giant files load in less than a second from my experience. Although the commands seem cryptic at first, they actually make sense and are not that difficult to remember usually. Quite a few full-blown IDE's have vi mode that is either built-in or is configurable which allows you to use Vi commands in order to edit text. It's very hard to give justice to a text editor that was invented before the mouse was commonly used (and doesn't use it either).<br>

<strong>How do i use Vi/Vim?</strong><br>

To ease my explanation, and simultaneously show you how full featured Vi/Vim is, I have included 2 cheat sheets.<br>

<a href="http://www.worldtimzone.com/res/vi.html" style="text-decoration: underline">Easy Cheat Sheet</a> - I Actually learned how to use Vi by referencing this same cheat sheet very often.<br>

<a href="http://michael.peopleofhonoronly.com/vim/" style="text-decoration: underline">Difficult Cheat Sheet</a> and a full article on these detailed and full cheat sheets can be found <a href="http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html" style="text-decoration: underline">here</a>.<br>

As you can see, this is quite full featured, and this is all just default functionality. You also have a .vimrc file that is kept in your profile and another copy is up in /etc. These can be used to extend the functionality of Vi and Vim.<br>

Another thing you can do is if you have vi or vim installed on your machine (99% of Linux machines I have logged into have Vi already installed, so it's a good idea to learn just for that reason!) is to run &quot;vimtutor&quot; in a terminal. This is built into Vi/Vim and taught me a lot more about Vi/Vim after I thought I knew a lot. None of it is advanced, and everything they teach you in there has a line for you to test what you just learned on.<br>

<h3 id="s3">You mentioned a game?</h3>

Yep! I just discovered this game my self about 30 minutes ago when I was looking though another piece to show you guys. Unfortunately I don't have the plugins installed right now to play it, but looking though what I can see, it looks like a lot of potential fun.<br>

Also, its not really a &quot;game&quot; so to say, but it will help you create a tiny Linux environment in a virtual world and then teach you to do all kinds of awesome things inside of it.<br>

It's called &quot;<a href="http://nixsrv.com/llthw" style="text-decoration: underline">Learn Linux the Hard Way</a>&quot;, but it looks to me like it's only pulling your tail. It gives you a tiny Linux environment with minimal tools and teaches you to use various commands. Go check em out, if you don't know what I'm talking about, scroll down to the bottom of the page. The layout isn't the greatest, so at the bottom is exercise
