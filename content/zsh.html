<h3><em><strong>I have permanently switched to ZSH!</strong></em></h3>

<h4><em><strong>Why? FISH was so awesome!</strong></em></h4>

<p>
As some of you know, I switched my primary shell to FISH //ARTICLE LINK// a while ago, but I have since switched to ZSH and i see no reason to go back to FISH.<br/>
One of the main reasons im probably never going back is Oh-My-ZSH. //LINK TO REPO HERE//<br/>
All of the advantages of ZSH over FISh are mostly astetic for me.
