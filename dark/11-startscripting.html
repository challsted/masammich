				<h2>Writing Your First Script</h2>
				Every good script has a few sections to it:<br/>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#shebang">SheBang(#!)</a></li>
					<li><a href="#comments">Comments</a></li>
					<li><a href="#orderofoperations">Order Scripts are Read</a></li>
					<li><a href="#logic">Logic</a></li>
				</ul>

				A shell script always starts out with what is known as a <strong id="shebang"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29">SheBang</a> </strong>, then a series of characters which tells the shell that is reading the script how to read it.<br/>
				This might sound kind of strange to you, but Ill do my best to explain this. 

				If you type "echo $SHELL" into your terminal, more then likely you will see 
				"<code class="codeOutput">/bin/bash/</code>" or "<code class="codeOutput">/usr/bin/bash</code>" spit back out at you. This is normal, and if you get something else its ok too, as long as its not an error or nothing at all.<br/>

				What this means is that you are in the "BAShell" which stands for "Bourn Again Shell" (sh stands for shell in this case).</br>

				But the purpose of this article is not to write "Bash" scripts, its to write "Shell" scripts. If your goal is to learn "bash" or "ksh" or something similar, then this is where you need to start. Bash takes SH and builds on top of it to give it more features and better syntax. If you learn basic shell scripting, you can run these scripts on almost any Linux/Unix Box. Then if you want to start using the extra features of BASH, you will already have the basic knowledge, and all you will need is the special "sugar" that bash provides.<br/>

				So, the main thing you will see as the top line of every script (well, you SHOULD always see this as the top line) is something like:<br/>

				<code class="codeInput">#!/bin/sh</code>&lt;-- I recommend you use this one for everything we discuss here, unless specified otherwise.<br/>

				<code class="codeInput">#!/bin/bash</code><br/>

				<code class="codeInput">#!/bin/ksh</code><br/>

				<code class="codeInput">#!/local/bin/bash</code><br/>

				<code class="codeInput">#!/bin/zsh</code><br/>

				<code class="codeInput">#!/usr/bin/ksh</code><br/>

				<br/>
				CAUTION: If you happen to run your script, and it says that it is not able to find /bin/sh. Please type "which sh" into your terminal, it will output a location to "sh" please use that at the top of your scripts. <br/><br/>

				Next you need to know how to do something that is very important, and that separates good code form bad code.<br/>

				<strong id="comments">COMMENTS!!</strong>

				Anything that starts with a <code class="codeInput">#</code> and the 2nd character is not a <code class="codeInput">!</code> will be ignored by the shell.<br/>

				This is a good time and place to add little notes to yourself, or notes to anyone who might read your script.<br/>

				Some good times to write notes are:<br>

				<ul>
					<li>It is highly encouraged to open your script with a few details like what is the purpose of the script?, who made it (your name), when you last updated it(date), or even some kind of a version number.</li>
					<li>Just wrote a big loop? Add a comment to explain what you wrote.</li>
					<li>Even if you don't think ANYONE else will EVER read your script, you should still leave yourself a note, because its very likely, that one day you will look though the script again, and it would be nice if you could read a few simple notes/comments and know what it is for!</li>
				</ul>

				<strong id="orderofoperations">Order Scripts are Read</strong> If you have ever written a program in C/C++, then you have "compiled" the program, and while it was compiling, every missing semicolon, every missing &gt; or &lt; will throw an error, and when it does actually compile, the program is at the very least, devoid of typing errors. This is not so in shell. You type the script out, then you run the script. There is no compile, there is no error checking. <br/>

				If you have never written in any other languages, then you wont have any expectations! I will still go over how a script is read in shell (and its derivatives). <br/>

				A shell script is read from top to bottom, and only while its needed. So you can have an error at the bottom of your script, and you wont know about it until you get to the bottom of the script. If you write a loop, that has an value initial value, 3 other options, then a else at the end. You need to input values that will output to all of the options to make sure they all work. We call this "QA" or "Quality Assurance" of the script. If you have 50 features, each feature with 3 different outcomes, then you need to test the script AT LEAST 150 times, getting the appropriate response each time. <br/>
				You might noise that the script works perfectly, as long as the user inputs the information you expect. But what if they put in something you didn't expect? This is where we need to test to make sure that the script doesn't break when we hit these not-so-often utilized pieces of our scripts. I will sometimes give you example input to test, and ideas of what to expect users to input sometimes and to check for this type of info. <br/>

				<strong id="logic">Logic</strong> will be covered starting in <a href="21-shellloops-if.html">lesson 2</a>. We need to understand <a href="12-basiccommands.html">basic commands</a> first.<br/>
