                    My previous article on VIM was rather lacking, it presented a game, some links to articles that puked data on to your lap, and I did little to try to assit you in your learning. I appoligize for that, and I shall attempt to rectafy that here, (excuse the puke though...)
                </p>
                <!-- Section 2 (b/c sect 1 is a outer link)-->
                <h3 id="commands">VIM Commands</h3>
                <p>
                    As you should know, vim is a Modal Commandline Text Editor. Which, as I understand it, means that it uses modes, i always think of it as a "mode cli text editor". So it uses "modes" to edit or add text. If you have zero expierence with vim, and you have it installed. Just type <code class="codeInput">vim</code> into your terminal. It will open a "vim tutor" which attempts to teach you vim, you also have the option of playing the game I mentioned before which can be found at <a href="http://vim-adventures.com/" style="text-decoration: underline">VimAdventures.com</a> thats pretty much a TLDR of the previous article. So lets get on with the VIM Commands shall we!<br/>
                </p>

                <h4 id="commands-beginner">Beginner Commands</h4>
                <p id="beginner-modes">
                    <strong>VIM Has "Modes"</strong><br/>
                    So first you need to understand what "mode" your in and what those modes mean.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    If you just opened vim, your in <strong>"Command"</strong> Mode. <br/>
                    In this mode all keystrokes are not interpreted as the letter you press. They all have meanings that we will learn soon. <br/>
                    You will know your in command mode when you do not see anything inside of brackets down in the bottom left.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next you have <strong>"Insert"</strong> Mode. <br/>
                    The easiest way to get to this mode is by hitting "i", but there are several other ways to get to insert mode. <br/>
                    You will know your in insert mode when a small "[INSERT]" appears at the bottom left of your screen.<br/> 
                    When you are in Insert mode, all of your keystrokes are not interpreted, instead they are taken as you type.<br/>
                    So if you hit the "i" key it types "i" instead of changing your mode.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next you have <strong>"Replace"</strong> mode.<br/>
                    The only way I know to get into insert mode is by pressing "R" (Capitol R). You can also go into temporary replace mode by pressing "r" (lowercase r)<br/>
                    You will know you are in replace mode when you see a small "[REPLACE]" appear at the bottom left of your screen.<br/>
                    When you are in Replace mode, any key you type will replace what is underneth the cursor. So if your cursor is hovering over a P and you press the T key, that O will be replaced by a T.<br/>
                    "Temporary" replace mode (as I refer to it) will only replace one character (the one under the cursor) then return you to command mode.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last mode you need to learn is <strong>"Visual"</strong> mode.<br/>
                    You can get to Visual mode a few differnt ways, but each way preforms a differnt type of "visual" task.<br/>
                    "Shift-V" puts you into "Visual Line" mode, this allows you to highlight single characters or full words.<br/>
                    "^V" (This means "Leader V" which by default is CTRL V) puts you into "Visual Block" mode, this allows you to edit whole lines at a time, useful to highlight full blocks of code or text.<br/>
                    You will know your in visual mode when you see "[VISUAL]" appear at the bottom left of your screen.<br/>
                    Visual Line and Visual Block are ment for High-Lighting text, I believe the only purpose of this is to "yank" (aka Copy) text <br/>

                    <strong>How to enter commands into VIM</strong><br/>
                    <br/>
                    Next you need to know when to enter commands, and how to leave differnt modes.<br/>
                    As I already said, by default your in "Command Mode", you have to go into other modes by pressing a a key, or a combo of keys.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    The "Escape" key (top left most key on all standard keyboards usually marked as "Esc") is ment to get you out anything.<br/>
                    If your ever in a strange mode, or if you just want to go back to command mode from Insert mode. You can hit the trusty esc key to get out of almost any mode.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Every key on the keyboard has some kind of a command tied to it, and most of them have 2 or more commands tied to them, so a command could be used by hitting the key, hititng shift then the key, hitting alt then the key("ALT" or &lt;ALT&gt;), hitting ctrl then the key ("^" or "CTRL" or &lt;CTRL&gt;), or hitting "leader" then the key which is "\" by default (&lt;leader&gt;).<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Now you need to know about ":" or "colon" commands.<br/>
                    Colon commands can only be entered from command mode. You enter them by typeing the colon key (":") then what ever the command is after the colon.<br/>
                </p>
                <hr class="medium">
                <p>
                    Commands we need to know first is how to <em>quit</em> VIM. The following commadns all "quit" vim. Key word is "quit" not "exit".<br/>
                    <code class="codeInput">:q</code>, <code class="codeInput">:q!</code>, <code class="codeInput">ZZ</code><br/>
                    So, thats ":q" I usually hear people pronounce this as "Colon Q". As mentioned above, this is only entered form command mode.<br/>
                    Please note that ZZ is 2 capitoal Z's.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Now you need to know how to "write" your file, again key word is "write" not "save".<br/>
                    <code class="codeInput">:w</code><br/>
                    But what if you want to Write the file and quit? Do you need to run <code class="codeInput">:q</code> then <code class="codeInput">:w</code>? NO! Vim allows for these 2 to be preformed at the same time, you can do this by typeing them together. like this:<br/>
                    <code class="codeInput">:wq</code> so you "write" then "quit". Do not try to ":qw" that would "quit" then it would never write the document because it quit... <br/>
                    What if you need to save the file to a differnt location, or in a differnt name?<br/>
                    <code class="codeInput">:w ~/other/folder</code> for writeing to a differnt location, or <code class="codeInput">:w differntName.txt</code> to write it as a differnt name (like "save as").<br/>
                    You can also combine this as <code class="codeInput">:w ~/location/to/a/place/notTheOrgionalName.sh</code>
                </p>

                <h3 id="plugins">PLUG-INS!</h3>
                <p>
                    So, VIM comes with a lot of features, and thing that can be done by default.<br/>
                    But as you have seen above, some times default isnt good enough, we play with settings to make it better or just personalized.<br/>
                    Now, some people said that this still isnt enough! So they submitted various features to the owner of VIM and were rejected, so rather then give up. They (and others) started makeing "plug-ins" to add functionality on top of default VIM. This action caught on and is now very popular in the VIM community (very few people DONT use plugins in fact) and there are now Plugins to do almost anything you can imageine (and more frequently being created). <br/>
                </p>

                <h4 id="plugins-where">Where can I find Plug-ins?</h4>
                <p>
                    A google search will teach you a lot! But here are a few links, i personally prefer to look though GitHub, and a few differnt reddit pages. <br>
                    <br/>
                    <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=vim+plugin" style="text-decoration: underline">GitHub Search</a><br/>
                    GitHub is where almost all plugins are hosted these days<br/>
                    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vimplugins" style="text-decoration: underline">Reddit VimPlugins</a><br/>
                    This is not a super "active" subreddit, but it still gets frequent hits.<br/>
                    If you like reddit you can also look into <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/HackingInfo/m/vim" style="text-decoration: underline">this multireddit</a><br/>
                    <a href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Plugin" style="text-decoration: underline">VIM Wiki</a><br/>
                    The vim wiki is both liked and hated by many. It is a true wikia, anyone can edit it, and yet only a few do. Its quite out of date in places and yet seeminly goes on forever, never ending, alwasy more info in it from somewhere that wasnt linked properly that can only be found by hitting the random article button...<br/>
                    
                </p>

                <h4 id="plugins-how">How do I install these?</h4>
                <p>
                    There are several ways to do this. You can do it manually, or you can use a plugin manager (recomended) to do it all for you. 
                    <p id="how-manual">
                        <strong>Manual</strong> although there is nothing wrong with doing it this way, if you plan on having more then a small number of plugins, it might be a good idea to use a plugin manager. But I will still list this way for research, and knowledge.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        So first you need to create a directory, then a few directorys underneth that, I'm not sure if this is 100% needed, but the way I will list here, is the way i was taught, and i always see others doing it this same way (even with a manager).<br/>
                        So, first create a folder called ".vim" at your home directory.<br/>
                        <code class="codeInput">mkdir ~/.vim</code><br/>
                        Now go into that directory and we need to create several more dirctorys, I'll explain what each one is for so you can not create them or just remove them if you dont want them.<br/>
                        <code class="codeInput">mkdir -p ~/.vim/{autoload,colors,plugged,swaps,spell}</code><br/>
                        The above will create 5 sub-directorys underneth ~/.vim. Each of these direcorys has a specific purpose.<br/>
                        <strong>autoload</strong> - If you want a certain file to load as soon as vim loads (at the same time) this is where you want to put the .vim file. This is mainly used to put what ever plugin manager you use (you put the manager's .vim file here) so you may or may not want it. Im leaving it in here because Im going to assume you want to just learn how it works, not actually doing allt his your self. <br/>
                        <strong>colors</strong> - This is used for all of your color schemes, being 100% honest, I have 179 colorschemes located in this file right now... I dont even know how I got this many... I probably downloaded a zip of them when i was playing with vim and forgot ... (i have several files still here that dont see to have been touched in ~a year...). I will suggest you wget or git clone your favorate colorscheme into this folder. Once vim sees you have a .vim, it seems to start referenceing it from that point on. So forexample, i LOVE the molokai color scheme, so i cloned it into my ~/.vim/colors dir so i can reference it with my .vimrc.<br/>
                        <strong>plugged</strong> - Put all of your pluggin files here <br/>
                        <strong>swaps</strong> - You need to set in your .vimrc to use this for swap files. Its more convient then having random .~filename floating everywhere you forgot to save or quit properly and left a shadow file behind... <br/>
                        <!-- ADD HOW TO DO THIS -->
                        <strong>spell</strong> - If you chose to turn on spell check in vim, this is where it will save your spell file. Which is where it saves all the words you add or tell it to ignore in a little file.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Thats about it, you either wget or git clone the .vim file's into the appropriate place. Colorscheme into the "colors" dir, plugins into the "plugged" dir, files to load on launch into the "autoload" dir and the others you setup to have files put into automatically.<br/>

                        <strong>Manager</strong> This is highly recamended, it makes your life far easier due to it takes the process of updateing, and placeing files where they need to go out of the picture. Please see the individual links on how to install the sepearte plugin, the process changes over time, and I dont want to be behind a revision or 2 for how to install.

                            <strong><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug" style="text-decoration: underline">Vim-Plug</a></strong><br/>
                            I personally use this manager. I use because it works in both vim and <a href="#neovim">NeoVim</a>.<br/>
                            It installs and updates in paralell.<br/>
                            It allows you to load specific branch or a tag of a plugin, so you can play with experimental versions of a plugin<br/>

                            One of the strengths of Pathogen, is that it creates seperate folders for every plugin, and inside of that folder, is everything the plugin needs to work.<br/>
                            The benefit of this is that 1 plugin wont effect the others you have.<br/>
                            Another benefit of this is that if you want to remove a plugin, you simply remove that directory that is named after the plugin.<br/>                            
                        </p>

                            The Benefit of Vundle is that it is actually built on top of pathogen, so you get all the benefits of pathogen, but you also get a management interface within vim. This is the most popular vim plugin manager that I know of, most plugins you find on GitHub will have vundle instructions on how to use it.
