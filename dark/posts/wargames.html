				<h3><em><strong>Who doesn't love games?</strong></em></h3>

				What if you could learn Linux, while playing a type of game? No, there isn't pretty graphics, but just like any other game, you get instant gratification and a great feeling of accomplishment. Depending on the site/layout you might even get points, leader boards, achievements, avatars.... some of the high end and popular ones even have cash prizes! Sound fun? First let’s take a look at what a war-game is, then where to find them and a few recommendations.<br/>

				<h3><em><strong>What are "war games"?</strong></em></h3>

				If you’re thinking about "Toy Soldier" or "Call of Duty" then you’re nowhere near what I’m talking about. "War-games" are Linux hacking exercises that are laid out like a game. I know of several types of these war games, and they vary widely in the way you go about executing them. Let’s go over a few types.<br/>

				<br/>

				<ol>
					<li><a href="#vpn">VPN/SSH</a></li>
					<li><a href="#root">VM - Rooting</a></li>
					<li><a href="#online">Online/Browser-based</a></li>
				</ol>

				<h3><em><strong id="vpn">VPN/SSH</strong></em></h3><br/>

				So, as the name suggests, you connect to a server hosted on the public internet using either a VPN (Virtual Private Network) or SSH (Secure SHell). These usually have various difficulties and usually have a direct goal in mind. For example the "<a href="http://www.overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/">Bandit</a>" exercises found over on <a href="http://www.overthewire.org/wargames/">OTW</a>. They are aimed at beginners and teach you everything from very basic "cat a file to get the output" to more advanced privilege elevation and exploitation of the way the system works. I went through all of these myself and they actually gave me a nice challenge and I had a lot of fun. If you get though all of these and you want more then I suggest you donate a few bucks to them so you can have access to the rest.<br/>

				If you want to try out a VPN based war-game go check out <a href="https://pwn0.com/">pwn0.com</a> you need to sign up for this one, but once you get signed in everything will kind of hit you all at once. The idea here is that you try to gain "root" (aka admin priv) on as many box's as you can. You "tag" your name onto root to get onto the scoreboards. The first few boxes are very easy and shouldn't give you too much of a challenge if you know anything about counter security.<br/>

				Another personal favorite of mine is <a href="https://www.hacking-lab.com/index.html">Hacking-Lab</a> you sign up, download a "Live CD" and you hack from the live Linux distro. Everything you need is all setup on the liveCD so you don't need to download or setup anything on your personal computer. There are tons of challenges that range from very easy web-exploits to taking control of a bot-net.<br/>

				<h3><em><strong id="root">VM - Rooting</strong></em></h3>

				This is a part that usually requires a little higher knowledge of offensive security, usually requires at least a little programming knowledge with Bash, Python, C, or Perl. But even without either, you can bump around and feel around an offline VM (Virtual Machine), maybe even find a few that don't require programming knowledge!<br/>

				I have little experience in this area but my research has lead me to find quite a few sites that offer VM's to download, stand up, and fire away at. Let me do a quick explanation of what a VM is, how to use a VM, and a quick suggestion of how to exploit them.<br/>

				<h4><em><strong>What is a Virtual Machine?</strong></em></h4>

				A virtual machine is a full computer system, in what is called an "image". Not like a jpeg or a png file but in a format that can be read by a virtualization software.<br/>

				<h4><em><strong>How do I open a VM?</strong></em></h4>

				I recommend <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> (<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Download</a>) due to its free, its very easy to use, and its opensource! I will do a full guide on how to setup a Linux VM soon, but for now please Google it if you need assistance.<br/>

				So, for example, you download a vm image in ".ovf" format. You load it up into virtual box (import), and you turn it on.
				In most cases, that's all you need to do to "stand up" a virtual machine from a pre-configured format like ovf. Once you’re inside the VM I can’t create a guide on what you need to do. The various challenges should be spelled out for you by the website you got the VM from.<br/>

				<h4><em><strong>How can I exploit a VM from another VM?</strong></em></h4>

				Here is where it gets not only VERY fun, but also quite complicated. You need another VM, 99.9% of the time you will want to use a Linux distro called "<a href="http://www.kali.org/">Kali</a>". Why Kali? Because Kali is a full Linux distribution dedicated to the exploiting of systems, just like what your practicing!<br/>

				This is not necessary though, in the beginning you will be exploiting a VM from within the VM. So the tools needed to exploit it will already be available and you won’t need external tools to hack and crack your way in. But you will eventually need to do this.<br/>
				<h4><em><strong>So where do I get these VM's?</strong></em></h4>

				A few sites I have found that I will recommend are:<br/>

				<a href="http://www.exploit-exercises.com/">Exploit-Exercises.com</a> they have several wargames pre-setup in VM format. Each has there own difficulties and followings.<br/>

				<a href="http://www.damnvulnerablelinux.org/">Damn Vulnerable Linux</a> (DVL) this is an intentionally badly setup and full of well known vulnerability. There are several sites that exist that offer challenges in order to exploit various pieces of DVL. DVL its self is not a Wargame so to say, but many wargames have been built that use DVL as their VM of choice.<br/>

				<a href="http://www.dvwa.co.uk/">Damn Vulnerable Web App</a> (DVWA) this is similar to DVL but using a large webapp instead. It teaches PHP/MySQL exploits.
				<h3><em><strong id="online">Online/Browser Based</strong></em></h3><br/>

				This is if you don't want to get your hands dirty with ssh or downloading programs and VM's. Although these can become very advanced they are usually used as an initial feet wetting exercises. They don't require any extra tools although extra tools can make the job easier (like Kali mentioned above has tools meant to do some of the things on these sites).<br/>

				<a href="http://www.hackthissite.org/">Hack This Site</a> as it sounds, the overall goal, its to "hack this site" the whole site teaches you various ways to exploit a vulnerable website mainly using XSS (Cross Site Scripting). One good thing about this site, is its very active, it has a large community and is always growing.<br/>

				Thats all for now folks!<br/>

				If I find any more information on good sites or if I find some more that I personally have tried and think worthy of your eyes, then ill share them on here.<br/>

				Have fun, and don't do anything stupid! The stupid will be punished. I am not responsible if you choose to be one of the stupid.<br/>
