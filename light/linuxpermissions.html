				<h2>Linux File System Permissions</h2>

				<ol>
					<li> <a href="#s1">What does drwxrwxr-- mean? Lets Find Out!</a></li>
					<li> <a href="#s2">How do I change these permissions?</a></li>
					<li> <a href="#s3">Users and Groups and World! Oh My!</a></li>
				</ol>

				<h3 id="s1">1. Basic Permissions</h3>

				Ok, to start, were going to need to learn a new flag for a command you should already know.<br/>

				<code class="codeInput">ls -l</code> The "<code class="codeInput">-l</code>" part of this is called a "flag", this specific flag, its description is "use a long listing format" I know that doesn't make that much since. So to describe it in my own words, it gives "details" to a simple "ls" I have attached a screen shot to show what it outputs for my personal home directory.<br/>

				<a href="http://masammich.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/ss-ls-l.png"><img src="http://masammich.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/ss-ls-l.png" alt="ls -l screenshot" width="525" height="214" /></a></br>

				So, lets go over what all this says first.<br/>


				Lets take that first line:<br/>

				<code class="codeOutput">-rw-r--r-- 1 chase users 133763 Mar 7 21:09 6fg6hWI.png</code><br/>

				<em><strong>WHAT THE FOX DOES THAT MEAN?</strong></em><br/>

				Ok, lets break it up into 8 sections<br/>

				<ol>
					<li><a href="#s1-1" class="codeOutput">-rw-r--r--</a><br/></li>
					<li><a href="#s1-2" class="codeOutput">1</a><br/></li>
					<li><a href="#s1-3" class="codeOutput">chase</a><br/></li>
					<li><a href="#s1-4" class="codeOutput">users</a><br/></li>
					<li><a href="#s1-5" class="codeOutput">133763</a><br/></li>
					<li><a href="#s1-6" class="codeOutput">Mar 7</a><br/></li>
					<li><a href="#s1-7" class="codeOutput">21:09</a><br/></li>
					<li><a href="#s1-8" class="codeOutput">6fg6hWI.png</a><br/></li>
				</ol>
				
				<strong id="s1-1"><em>1)</em></strong> This is the actual "permissions" its broken into 10 separate bits.<br/>

				The first bit is a little strange, it will usually be a "-", "d" or "l". This first bit represents if "special" permissions need to take effect or not. For this example it's a "-" so no special permissions need to take effect. If it were a "d" as in several of the lines above, this would mean that it is a directory (a folder). If it is a "l" than it is a link. Links will be explained later as they are special and very useful!<br/>

				Next 9 bits can be grouped into 3 sets of 3. So rw- then r-- then r--<br/>

				This is where things start getting a little confusing for most people. Because each of these groups of 3 represent 3 different types of permissions. Which will be explained more in section 3. But to give a quick explanation of what they are just because I need to, its User, Group, World.<br/>

				<strong id="s1-2"><em>2)</em></strong> This number 1 represents if anything is "linked" to here. In this case the "1" represents that it is linked to here and nothing else. If you look at the "4" that means 3 other places are linked to that 1 folder! As I said above, I will explain links more later. For now, just now that it means how many links are pointing here.<br/>

				<strong id="s1-3"><em>3)</em></strong> This is the "owner" of the file. So this is the account that is effected by the first set of 3 (rw- in the example) permissions.<br/>

				<strong id="s1-4"><em>4)</em></strong> This part is the "group" of this file. So this is the "group" that is being effected by the 2nd set of 3 (r-- in the example) permissions.<br/>

				<strong id="s1-5"><em>5)</em></strong> This is the size of the file, in kilobits. Simple enough.<br/>

				<strong id="s1-6"><em>6)</em></strong> This is the last day the file was modified, so I last modified this on March 7th.<br/>

				<strong id="s1-7"><em>7)</em></strong> This is the last time i modified the file. Its written in 24 hour format. So at 9:09pm.<br/>

				<strong id="s1-8"><em>8)</em></strong> This is the name of the actual file. In this case, it's a randomly generated named picture. I know its a picture because i know what ".png" is a file format used for pictures.<br/>

				<h3><em><strong>So what do these letters "r", "w" and "x" actually mean???</strong></em></h3>

				To put it very simply (because this part is): Read, Write, Execute.<br/>

				That's it.<br/>

				Each of them is does the "owner" of the file have permission to Read, Write, or Execute? Dose the group? Dose the "World"? You'll learn much more about these 3 groups very soon.<br/>

				<h3 id="s2">2. Changing permissions with Chmod and Chown</h3>

				So, lets say you and a friend both use this computer. So lets assume your name is Chase (like in my example) and the friend who uses your computer's name is Jason.<br/>

				So you're a member of the group "users" and Jason is a member of the group "users" also.<br/>

				You have a folder that is owned by you, and the group users. So it looks like this.<br/>

				<code class="codeInput">drw-rw-r-- chase user</code><br/>

				This will allow both you and Jason to read and write to this folder.<br/>

				If you wanted to make it so that the group "user" could no longer write to the folder you can do that easily. With a command named "chmod". I remember this by thinking "CHange or MODify" it actually means "Change a file's mode bits" but that's a little confusing.<br/>

				Just to show you the command in order to take away Jason's ability to write to the folder. It would be<br/>

				<code class="codeInput">chmod 644</code><br/>

				<em><strong>"???????" You may be thinking.</strong></em><br/>

				What do numers have to do with the letters rwx? So, you remember how I have been calling the "bits" this whole time. Thats because they are actually written in binary (1 or 0) but your shell shows them to you in a much more easy to read way.<br/>


				<em><strong>Binary? I'm not a computer, how do I read binary?</strong></em><br/>

				So, you only need to know 3 spaces of binary. This wont be hard. Binary is read from right to left, unlike English which is left to right. As I already said, its written in 1's and 0's. So how do you count to 644 with 1's and 0's unless you add 644 1's together!?<br/>

				Ok, so as i said, you read binary from left to right. So let's make a few sets of 3 binary numbers and what they mean then show them in Linux.<br/>
				
				<code class="codeOutput">100 = r--</code><br/>
				<code class="codeOutput">110 = rw-</code><br/>
				<code class="codeOutput">111 = rwx</code><br/>
				<em><strong>But that still doesn't explain how you got 644!</strong></em><br/>

				So each place doubles as you count, the first space is a 1, the 2nd space a 2 (2 times 1), the 3rd space is 4 (2 times 2). So when you look at 111 you can count 4+2+1 = 7. So lets re-write what we did above but using numbers also.<br/>

				<code class="codeOutput">100 = 4 = r--</code><br/>
				<code class="codeOutput">110 = 6 = rw-</code><br/>
				<code class="codeOutput">111 = 7 = rwx</code><br/>

				Make more sense? Maybe? Hopefully? Please?<br/>

				Ok, so 644 tells your shell to change the permissions to "Owner has Read and Write, Group has Read, World has read" (remember 6 is rw- and 4 is r--).<br/>

				So now when you do an <code class="codeInput">ls -l</code> on the folder you will see:<br/>

				<code class="codeInput">drw-r--r-- chase user</code><br/>

				So now Chase can read and write to the folder, and Jason (who is a member of the "user" group, can only read from that folder).<br/>

				<em><strong>But you said "chmod and chown" what is chown?</strong></em><br/>

				chown is "change ownership", so if you found a file that was owned by Jason, and it is called "file_from_jason" and you moved it from his home directory into yours. Move (mv) as you will learn preserves permissions. So if it was owned by Jason and the group user only had r permissions to it. But you need to be able to read and write to it. Then one of your options would be to change the ownership of the file.<br/>
				So in this example you could type<br/>

				<code class="codeInput">chown chase user file_from_jason</code><br/>

				This will now change the file to be owned by chase, and the group will be user. All the permissions will stay the same other than this.<br/>
